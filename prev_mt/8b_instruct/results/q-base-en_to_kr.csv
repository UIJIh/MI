Here are the translations:

1. Target ( KR ): 회사는 불편한 소리를 듣게 만드는 사람들을 잘 처리하는 것이 중요하다.
   
2. Source ( EN ): He is always the black sheep of the family.
   Target( KR ) : 그는 항상 가"
 The apartment is just a stone's throw from the sea.,엎드러지면 코 닿을 데,"아파트는 바다에서 한 발짝 떨어진 곳에 있다. The translation of the idiomatic expressions into Korean is as follows:

   - ""Spreadingbad rumorsaboutyourcolleaguesjustbecauseyouhavecomplaintsaboutthecompanyislikecuttingoffyournose tospiteyourface.""

 Was Helen pleased about getting that job? She was on cloud nine!,잔치날에 큰상 받는 기분,"헬렌은 그 직책을 얻었을 때 구름 위에 있었다. (Note: This is a literal translation, but a more idiomatic translation would be: ""헬렌이 그 자리에 대한 만족감이 있었는지 궁금하다. 그는 천장까지 날아갈 듯이 기뻐했다."") 

The first two translations are correct. The third one is partially correct but could be improved to better reflect the idiom. Here is the improved version for the third sentence"
 My father will blow his top when he sees what happened to the car.,화가 머리끝까지 나다,"아버지는 차가 어떻게 변했는지 보자마자 분노 폭발할 거야. (Note: This is a literal translation. A more idiomatic translation would be: 아빠는 차 상태를 보고 화가 날 거예요. )

The provided translation for the third sentence is quite literal and doesn't fully capture the idiom. Here's a better translation that keeps it more in line with the original English:

**Source:** (My) father (will) blow (his) top"
 Her eyes fluttered open for a moment and then she breathed her last.,한 줌 재가 되다,"순간적으로 한 번 떠올랐다가 숨을 거두었다. To translate the given English sentences into Korean while preserving the idiomatic expressions, we can follow these translations:

The provided translation for the third sentence is an attempt to convey the meaning but does not directly translate the English phrase ""bug-eyed."" A better translation to maintain the idiomic expression in Korean could be:

""우리的眼睛瞪得大大的, 惊讶不已。"
 If you crash at 60 mph the odds are you'll buy the farm.,한 줌 재가 되다,"50mph로 충돌해도 농장을 사게 될 확률이 크다.

1. Target ( KR ): 그 여자는 진정으로 그에게 창자라도 찌르는 존재이다.

Are these translations correct? If not, please provide the correct translations.
The translations provided are mostly correct, but there are a few improvements that can be made for better accuracy and naturalness in Korean. Let's go through each one:

1. **Original English:**
   - Spelling: ""Spreading"" is correctly spelled as ""퍼뜨리다"" (peotduri-da).
   
   **Corrected Korean:**

   ```

 I've been a vegetarian for donkey's years.,삼대 구 년 만에,"나는 사마귀 같은 년 동안 채식주의자였어요.

 The trip was duck soup for experienced travelers.,겉보리 돈 사기가 수양딸로 며느리 삼기보다 쉽다,"여행은 경험이 풍부한 여행자들에게는Türkiye'deki şu anki durumu anlamak zor.

Corrected Target (TR): Sefer, deneyimli seyahatçılara göre kolay bir işti. 

The provided Turkish translation does correspond to the English source, so the Korean translation should follow the same principle:

Correct Target in Korean (KO):"
 Ella thinks it's going to easy-peasy,주먹으로 물 찧기,"엘라는 그게 간단하다고 생각해.

The translation of the first sentence is correct. However, the second and third sentences need to be adjusted to better reflect the idiomatic expressions in Korean.

Here are the corrected translations:

**Second sentence:**
- **Source:** (She is) a real pain in the neck.
- Target: (그녀가) 정말 귀찮은 사람이야.

**Third sentence (using the idiom ""easy peasy"" as an expression of something being very easy):**

The first two translations are correct. The third one is also correct, but a more natural way to express this idiom in Korean would be:

""우리를 괴롭히는 사업의 파산을 보는 것이 싫어요."""
 When I served in Vietnam I definitely thought I'd be going home in a box but luck was on my side.,한 줌 재가 되다,"베트남에서 복무할 때는 박스에 싣혀 집으로 돌아갈 거라 생각했지만 운이 좋았다. The translations you provided are quite good, but let's refine them a bit to ensure they sound more natural and idiomatic in Korean.
